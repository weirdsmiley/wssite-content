Here are my [dotfiles][1].

When I was still using Manjaro Linux back in 2019, I got a nudge to try
[i3wm][2]. It was my first experience with any window manager. And I spent
nearly 5 years with it, enjoying the absolute control over my workflow. Nearing
the end of 2023, when I finally decided to leave Manjaro (for good), I had a
bunch of options on my hand. Fedora looked really promising at that time. But
even then, I wasn't sure I was going to be using any tiling window manager. I
happily switched to Gnome in Fedora 40. I ran it along with XOrg so that I could
make my `capslock` key act as a `ctrl` when held and as an `escape` when pressed
once, using `setxkbmap` and `xcape`. But only after spending a few months there,
I realized I missed that finer control at my fingertips. So, I resumed searching
for a newer tiling window manager. I was also learning Haskell at that time, so
picking up [XMonad][3] was natural.

![XMonad Fastfetch](/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-fastfetch.png)

There are a lot of things that I like about XMonad apart from its standard
tiling manager features. I enjoy writing the configuration in Haskell. Where
ever possible, I try to leverage the benefits of Haskell's strong type system.
Defining keybindings with a strong type system ensures that I cannot go very
wrong with it. Using stack for building my configuration allows me to port the
entire configuration easily to other systems, which are my various virtual
machines. I have split configuration in various modules.

```
src
├── Keybindings.hs
├── Layout.hs
├── Plugins
│   ├── Bluetooth.hs
│   ├── Pomodoro.hs
│   └── Soundtrack.hs
├── Preferences.hs
├── Theme
│   ├── Dmenu.hs
│   ├── Font.hs
│   ├── Theme.hs
│   └── Xresources.hs
├── Workspaces.hs
├── xmobar.hs
└── xmonad.hs

3 directories, 13 files
```

If you want to poke around the config according to your needs, go through
[Preferences.hs][4]. It contains lots of variables which can be customized like
terminal emulator, browser, scratchpads, window gap size etc. It also contains a
list of applications which you would like to start automatically at boot.

Overall, the modularization has turned out to be pretty in terms of categorizing
things. I tried writing a few [xmobar][5] plugins for my own needs. The
[guide][6] for writing them was straightforward to begin with. I also wrote my
entire xmobar configuration in Haskell itself, keeping this executable in the
same project. In the end, the project itself became a one-shot way for an entire
desktop environment which I can easily clone, compile and install on any system.

# 1. Setup

I will go briefly over the stack-based setup. The only thing needed is to have a
`build` script at the root of your xmonad project. Everything else is simply a
normal stack project with modules and a few executables. I have 2 executables in
my project: xmonad and xmobar.

A detailed description and example build files can be found [here][7]. My build
script is simple enough.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

SRC_DIR=$HOME/.config/xmonad
WM=xmonad

unset STACK_YAML
FAIL=0

cd $SRC_DIR
stack install 2>.log || FAIL=1

ln -f -T $(stack exec -- which $WM) $1 2>.log || FAIL=2
```

# 2. Installation

![XMonad Workflow](/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-workflow.png)

[Stack][8] is a package manager for Haskell projects and it will be used to
compile the package. Install stack either via [GHCup][9] or your distribution's
package manager.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/xmonad
git clone --branch release https://github.com/weirdsmiley/xmonad $HOME/.config/xmonad/
cd $HOME/.config/xmonad
./install.sh
```

The installation script will install a few fonts and other tools which are
default for this setup. It will also write `.xinitrc` and `.Xresources` files.

After the installation is complete, and you are logged into xmonad, pressing
`alt+shift+/` or `alt+?` will open up a dialog box containing all available
keybindings.

# 3. Diving in

## 3.1. Layouts and per-workspace layouts

XMonad provides a very easy way to describe various layouts that workspaces can
follow. I found it useful to constrain only a few layouts on each workspace.  I
used [PerWorkspace][10] for this. This allows me to only switch between
specified set of layouts. So for example, my workspace 2 is my writing
workspace, in which I have 3 applications.  A browser, a pdf reader and a
terminal with a tmux session attached to it. This can simply be arranged as a
three column layout. But sometimes certain pdfs may have smaller font size which
can be tough to read in a column. If I zoom in the pdf it spills sideways, and I
have to use arrow keys or h,l to move left and right.

![Three column layout](/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-three-col.png)

To tackle this, I have another layout with added magnification on top of the
three column layout.  It magnifies the focused window by a certain limit. And
having only these two layouts in my layout set helps me in easily cycling
between layouts. I don't have to skip through 4 different layouts which I would
never use in this workspace.

![Three column layout with magnification](/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-three-col-magnified.png)

## 3.2. Topbar modification

By default, XMonad adds a border to the tiled window which is in focus. I took
this idea from [here][11]. This adds a title bar with formatted colors. This
looks nicer that having a border surrounding the window. The focused window is
colored blue while unfocused is colored black. Also, having the title names in
topbar looks nice, and in a way removes the need of using XMonadLog's
application names in xmobar itself.

![Window topbar unfocused](/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-topbar-unfocused.png)

## 3.3. Type safety in keybindings

This is something which I truly adore about XMonad and writing its
configuration in Haskell. I can write my keybindings in a functional manner
and leverage Haskell's type system to ensure safety. Arranging keybindings in
this way, seems more fruitful than having them represented via strings.

```haskell
myKeys :: XConfig Layout -> M.Map (KeyMask, KeySym) (X ())
myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList -- list of keybindings
    $ [
      -- Restart XMonad
      ( (modm, xK_q), safeSpawn "xmonad" ["--restart"])
      -- Toggle fullscreen
      , ((modm, xK_f), sendMessage $ Toggle NBFULL)
      -- Lock screen
      , ((modm, xK_l), unGrab *> safeSpawn "env" myLockscreen)
      ]
```

Each keybinding is comprised of two values of types: `KeyMask` and `KeySym`,
followed by an `X ()` action. If you don't want to set a keymask simply pass a
`0` or `noModMask`.

## 3.4. Submap keybindings and makeChords

Using [submaps][12] in xmonad-contrib, I can write a utility function to easily generate a set of keybindings with an added description.

```haskell
import XMonad.Actions.Submap
import qualified Data.Map as M

makeChords :: a -> [((KeyMask, KeySym), String, X ())] -> [(a, X ())]
makeChords majorKey subKeys =
  (majorKey, submap . M.fromList $ map (\(k, _, a) -> (k, a)) subKeys)
    : [ ( majorKey
        , visualSubmap myVisualSubmapDef
            $ M.fromList
            $ map (\(k, d, a) -> (k, (d, a))) subKeys)
      ]

soundChords modm =
  makeChords
    (modm, xK_a)
    [ ( (0, xK_a), "open alsamixer"
      , spawn $ myNamedTerminal "alsamixer" ++ " -e alsamixer")
    , ( (0, xK_m), "toggle music playing"
      , getRunningPlayer' >>= \player ->
          spawn $ myMusicCtrl ++ " -p \"" ++ player ++ "\" play-pause")
    ]

myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList $ [] ++ soundChords modm
```

The `makeChords` adds two distinct sets of keybindings, one normal set and
another a visual set, which creates a dialog box when you press the main submap
key. In the example above, the `soundChords` submap is enabled with `alt+a`,
then you can see a dialog box containing two keybindings with their
descriptions. Pressing either `a` or `m` will launch the first or the second
action. The
[documentation][13]
also contains an example which you can read to see the actual code that will be
appended to your myKeys.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-makeChords.png"
  alt="My visual submap for soundChords" />
</div>

## 3.5. Xmobar configuration in Haskell

Writing the Xmobar configuration inside the same project really allows me
to keep everything in one place. I create another executable alongside the
xmonad executable, in my `package.yaml`. And then xmonad launches xmobar in the
startup apps section.

```yaml
executables:
  xmonad:
    main: xmonad.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmonad
      - xmonad-contrib
      - containers
  xmobar:
    main: xmobar.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmobar
    ghc-options: -rtsopts -threaded -with-rtsopts=-N
```

You may have noticed a small icon beside my layout icons on the left side of
xmobar. The represent the current layout in a visual form. Try switching layouts
with `alt+space` and see the icons change.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-xmobar.png"
  alt="xmobar" />
</div>

```haskell
myXmobarPP =
  def
    { ppLayout =
        \case
          "Columns" -> "<icon=Columns.xpm/>"
          "MagnifiedColumns" -> "<icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/>"
          "Full" -> "<icon=Full.xpm/>"
          "Tall" -> "<icon=Tall.xpm/>"
          "ThreeCol" -> "<icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/>"
          "2-by-3 (left)" -> "<icon=TwoByThreeLeft.xpm/>"
          "2-by-3 (right)" -> "<icon=TwoByThreeRight.xpm/>"
          "2x3 LT" -> "<icon=TwoByThreeLeftWithTabs.xpm/>"
          "2x3 RT" -> "<icon=TwoByThreeRightWithTabs.xpm/>"
          "Tiled" -> "<icon=Tiled.xpm/>"
          _ -> "<icon=Unknown.xpm/>"
    }

main =
  xmonad
    . withEasySB (statusBarProp "xmobar" (pure myXmobarPP)) defToggleStrutsKey
    $ myConfig
```

## 3.6. Scratchpads in action

I am using 4 scratchpads in total. Each scratchpad is mapped to a keybinding.

```haskell
  [
  -- Open Scratchpad
  ((modm, xK_Return), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "terminal")
  -- Open Kanboard session
  , ((modm, xK_x), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "Kanboard")
  -- Open CalibreWeb
  , ((modm, xK_z), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "CalibreWeb")
  -- Open Anki
  , ((modm, xK_m), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "Anki")
  ]

myScratchpads
 =
  [ NS "terminal" spawnTerm findTerm manageTerm
  , NS "Kanboard" spawnKanboard (className =? "Kanboard") doFullFloat
  , NS "Anki" spawnAnki (className =? "Anki") doFullFloat
  , NS "CalibreWeb" spawnCalibreWeb (className =? "CalibreWeb") doFullFloat
  ]
  ...
```

I realized that I don't really open new terminals that often because I use tmux
(with [tmux-resurrect][14] and [tmux-continuum][15]). So I remapped `alt+enter`
with showing the terminal scratchpad, instead of the usual, open a new terminal.

I can open up the calibre-web instance with `alt+z`, and immediately resume
whatever I was reading.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/posts/moving-back-to-a-tiling-wm-xmonad-calibreweb.gif"
  alt="Calibre-Web gif" />
</div>
