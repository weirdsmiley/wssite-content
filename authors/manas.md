With experience in systems, I combine my passion for compiler development with
contributions to the LLVM project and a keen interest in MLIR. I have strong
foundations in working with C++ and Rust, and I also dabble with C, Python,
Haskell and Erlang on the side.

I have worked on various stages of a compilation pipeline, such as working with
high-level abstract syntax trees in Clang Static Analyzer and other tools, while
also working on the LLVM IR doing static analysis and code optimization for
high-performing code generation. I have decent exposure with X86 assembly,
assemblers and debuggers as well.

I talk here about compilers, programming languages, quantum computing,
literature and philosophy.
